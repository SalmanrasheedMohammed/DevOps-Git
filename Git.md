# Git
* Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
* It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects, maintain a history of changes, and merge modifications seamlessly. 
* With Git, developers can work on separate branches, experiment with new features, and later merge their changes into the main codebase.
